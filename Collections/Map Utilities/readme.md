This alias allows DM's and Players do combat mapping inside Avrae, without the need to leave Discord. Utilizing notes inside of the Avrae `!init`, it allows you to draw a map and place combatants using [OTFBM](https://otfbm.io), including details such as a background, overlays, and objects.

More detailed help can be found inside the alias:

`!map help` - Basic Commands and Tokens
`!map help <manage|dm>` - Visual Options and Map Views
`!map help <over|spells>` - Overlays and Spells
`!map help <walls|doors|objects>` - Walls, Doors and Objects

**__First time using this alias?__**
